            Welcome to the website of Satria Imawan Adi Putra Pande! I am from Singaraja, Bali and currently a member of Bangkit Cohort CC-02. I have a great interest in the world of technology and strive to develop my skills in this field.
            
            Ever since I was young, I have had a keen interest in technology which has continued to grow over time. As a result, I decided to pursue an education in the field of technology in order to deepen my knowledge and become an expert in the field.
            
            Currently, I am participating in the prestigious Bangkit training program in Indonesia. I hope to learn more and develop my skills alongside experienced professionals in the technology industry.
            
            In addition, I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals. I believe that by working together, we can create amazing things and make positive contributions to society.
